# Contact Resistivity SMU
A source meter unit for contact resistivity measurement automation. 
Capstone project BJAM047 (2020) of the University of Melbourne.
# Source Code
This is not an opensource project but it does give its future user the freedom to develop further.
What is shown in this repo is only for demonstrating we did use C and developed our own branch of the firmware prototyped by our advisor for another similar device.
# If you are the future user
We will let you know who to talk to for the source code. Come to our project github page for contact details.
