# The Product
Contact resistivity measurement has been a repetitive and standardisable procedure of material characterisation in Labs, especially for those working on semiconductor materials. A programmable source measure unit (SMU) will be able to automate the measusing and calculation processes for researchers as a releaf from the boring part of their work. As a solution to measure resistivity automatically, this SMU is developed such that its user can expect a resistivity value displayed on the SMU in a few seconds after setting up the SMU and the object to measure.

The SMU being developed is compatible with material samples with 6 contacts. To output a resistivity value, the resistance values between adjacent contacts are frist measured and then processed by the ARM based  microcontroller of the SMU. Such calculation needs distances between the adjacent contacts as per user input.

The development of this SMU is performed by a group of three students under supervision as the final year project of their Master of Engineering degree in the University of Melbourne.
