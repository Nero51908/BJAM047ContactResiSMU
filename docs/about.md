# About
## The Product
Contact resistivity measurement is a repetitive and standardizable procedure.
This SMU is developed to switch sample and perform measurement automatically such that its user needs only to setup the SMU once and can expect a resistivity value from the SMU.
The SMU being developed is capable to contact with 6 sample points and measure resistance values between each two adjacent contacts.
To output a resistivity value, the measured resistance values are processed with distances between the adjacent contacts from user input.
